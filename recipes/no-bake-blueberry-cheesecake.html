        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This light and <em>airy</em> No-Bake Blueberry Cheesecake is one of our favorite summer
            desserts because it’s easy to make and doesn’t require heating up your oven.
            The texture is luxurious and it’s insanely delicious.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul><strong>Crust</strong>
                <li>1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs, from 14 whole crackers</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>8 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><strong>Filling</strong>
                <li>16 oz cream cheese, 2, 8-oz blocks, room temperature</li>
                <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp sour cream</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 recipe blueberry Topping (below), to serve</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><strong>Blueberry Topping</strong>
                <li>1/3 cup water for fresh berries, use 1/4 cup for frozen berries</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Cornstarch</li>
                <li>4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, 16-18oz</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol><strong>To Make Blueberry Topping:</strong>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, add water, lemon juice, sugar, and cornstarch. Use a spatula to stir
                until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set over medium heat and continue stirring until the mixture
                starts to thicken in about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add blueberries and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally and gently as they cook. When done,
                the berries will release some of their juice and turn syrupy, which takes about 5 to 6 minutes.
                Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol><strong>To Make No-Bake Cheesecake:</strong>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor, coarsely break up graham crackers then pulse into fine crumbs.
                Transfer crumbs to a bowl, add 1 Tbsp sugar and 8 Tbsp melted butter. Stir to evenly moisten crumbs.
                Line a 9-inch round springform pan with a round of parchment paper and press crumbs into the bottom
                of the pan going 1/2" up the sides. Freeze for 15 minutes or refrigerate 30 minutes for crumbs to set.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar with an electric hand mixer on medium/high
                speed for 3 minutes until fluffy and completely smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add sour cream
                and lemon juice and beat for another minute until well incorporated.</li>
                <li>Wash the mixer attachments and then in a second large mixing bowl, beat heavy whipping cream on
                medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, or until whipped and stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Using a spatula, fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until fully combined,
                scraping from the bottom of the bowl as you mix.</li>
                <li>Pour half of the filling over the cooled crust. Spoon 1/4 of the cooled blueberry sauce over the first
                cream cheese layer and lightly swirl over the top.</li>
                <li>Pour on the remaining cheesecake mixture and smooth out the top. Spoon and swirl 1/4 of the blueberry
                sauce over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight to fully set. To serve, top individual
                slices of cheesecake with the remaining blueberry sauce.</li>
            </ol>
