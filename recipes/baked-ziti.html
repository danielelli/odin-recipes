        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Baked Ziti is an Italian-American casserole of tubular-shaped ziti
            noodles with Marinara Sauce, ricotta, and loads of gooey, melty cheese.</p>
            <p>Think of Baked Ziti as a <em>lazy</em> lasagna- it has all the familiar
            flavors of Lasagna, without the fuss of layering the noodles.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb ziti pasta, or penne pasta or gluten-free pasta</li>
                <li>1 lb ground beef, 85% lean</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>5 cups marinara sauce</li>
                <li>15 oz fresh ricotta</li>
                <li>10 fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>12 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta in salted water according to package instructions
                until just al dente, then drain (do not overcook as the pasta will
                continue to cook in the oven).</li>
                <li>In a deep pan or Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, cook ground
                beef and onion, breaking up the beef with a spatula, until beef is
                fully cooked through and onions are softened (5-7 minutes).
                Add minced garlic, salt, pepper, and sauteé for another minute.
                Add 5 cups marinara sauce, bring to a simmer, and continue cooking
                for 5 minutes then turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Spread a ladle of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9×13 casserole dish.</li>
                <li>Add chopped basil and spoon in ricotta into the remaining sauce.
                Add cooked pasta and stir just until noodles are coated
                (you want to keep that ricotta texture)</li>
                <li>Transfer half of the pasta to the casserole dish. Top with 1/2
                of the shredded mozzarella and 1/2 of the grated parmesan.
                Add the remaining pasta and top with the remaining mozzarella and parmesan.</li>
                <li>Clear the edges of the pan so the cheese doesn’t burn onto the dish.
                Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes. Broil for 1-2 minutes to brown the cheese.
                Let cool for 5 minutes, then garnish with basil if desired and serve.</li>
            </ol>
