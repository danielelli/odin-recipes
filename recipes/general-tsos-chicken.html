                <li>1 tsp sesame seeds, optional for garnish</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><strong>General Tso's Sauce</strong>
                <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
                <li>5 tbsp low sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
                <li>4 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes. Toss chicken in batches with cornstarch,
                tapping off the excess. Set dredged chicken on a platter and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a separate dish, combine all the ingredients for your sauce and whisk
                to combine.</li>
                <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet with oil. Cook chicken in 2 to 3 batches,
                sauteeing until golden on both sides and cooked through then remove the
                chicken from the pan and transfer to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining 
                chicken, adding more oil as needed. Leave at least 1 Tbsp oil in the pan.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic, ginger and pepper flakes. Sautee for about 30 seconds
                or until fragrant.</li>
                <li> Add the sauce to the skillet and bring it to a simmer while stirring.
                Let it simmer for 1 minute to cook off the vinegar a little. Taste the sauce
                and add more soy sauce or rice vinegar to taste if desired. Add the chicken
                and toss to coat. Serve garnished with sesame seeds if desired.</li>
            </ol>
